* To run madgraph in the RU hexfarm, just download the script inside RUNGeneration and follow the instructions in the README file.
* RUNSimulations creates samples according to RunIISpring15DR74 campaing.
* RUNtuples is a modified version of the [B2GNtuple](https://github.com/cmsb2g/B2GAnaFW/tree/master), using the 74X version of the jetToolbox.
* RUNAnalysis uses the ntuples created with this version of the RUNtuples.
